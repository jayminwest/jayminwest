Hello! My name is Jaymin West and I am currently studying Computer Science at Gonzaga University with concentrations in both Philosophy and Film Studies. I'm interested in
everything related to computer science, however, Artificial Intellegece is where I'm headed. I'm especially concerened with the intersection between humans and computers and
our coevolution. I'm just getting started in the grand scheme of things so I'm in the middle of learning Python and Java, getting more comfortable with larger projects. I'm
willing to collaborate and work on any project as I all I want is to learn more about computer science. Cheers.
