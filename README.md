Jaymin West
Hey there! I'm Jaymin, the founder of Teach Nicheâ€”an open-source, full-stack platform where kendama players can create, sell, and buy tutorials. Built with React.js, Supabase, and Stripe, it's all about empowering the kendama community.

Previously, I worked on improving large language models at DataAnnotation using Python, SQL, and JavaScript, and tweaked search engine algorithms at TELUS International AI.

When I'm not coding, you might find me playing kendama or leading backcountry adventures. Always excited about new projects and collaborations!
